# MyProject
Repository for my project in the course Advanced Scientific Programming.
In the project I will rework some Matlab code where I create plots with data from .mat files. 
The plots include heat maps, fitting an error function to data, distributions of data and 
plots with errorbars. The plotting is done on data generated by post-processing calculations
from our image analysis pipeline.
