    '''Plots normalized fluorescent dots per cell in area bins.
    
    Function that plots normalized fluorescent dots per cell at different 
    area ranges. The areas correspond to different stages from birth to 
    division. Furthermore, the average initiation areas of all cells is 
    determined.
    
    Parameters
    ------------
    areas : numpy array with floats
            Array with areas of cells in frames where fluorescent 
            dots were detected.
    counts : numpy array with floats
             Array with the number of dots in cells.  
    longs : numpy array with floats 
            Array with internal long axis coordinates of fluorescent 
            dots in cells.
    lengths : numpy array with floats
              Array with cell lengths in frames where fluorescent dots 
              were detected.
    minLength : float (optional)
                Parameter for the lower boundry of allowed internal long 
                axis coordinates scaled with cell length.
    avgDivisionArea : float 
                      Average area at which cells divide.
        
    pixelSize : float (optional)
                Conversion factor between pixels and Âµm.
    showStatistics : Boolean
                     Flag to determine whether initiation area statistics
                     should be printed or not.
                      
    Returns 
    -----------
    dotsPerCell : numpy array with floats.
                  Normalized number of dots per cell within a given range 
                  of cell sizes given in area.
    areaBins : numpy array with floats   
               Binned cell areas.
    theFit : Tuple containing numpy arrays containing floats. 
             The first index in the tuple contains the constants 
             found by curve_fit when fitting dots per cell and areas 
             to errorfunc. The second index contains a 2D numpy array
             with estimated covariance of the constants in the first
             index.
    fig : figure object
          Contains figure that is created during the function. 
          Is returned so that the figure can be customized further.
    ax : axes objext
         Contains fig's axes object, which is created during the 
         function. Returned for further customization options.'''
