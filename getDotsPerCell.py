    '''Acquires number of dots per cell in area based bins.
    
    Function that acquires the number of fluorescent dots in cells within a 
    given cell size bin, where cell size corresponds to area. 
    
    Parameters
    -----------
    areas : numpy array with floats
            Array with areas of cells in frames where fluorescent dots were
            detected.
    counts : numpy array with floats
             Array with the number of dots in cells.  
    longs : numpy array with floats
            Array with internal long axis coordinates of fluorescent dots in
            cells.
    lengths : numpy array with floats
              Array with cell lengths in frames where fluorescent dots were 
              detected.
    minLength : float
                Parameter for the lower boundry of allowed internal long axis
                coordinates scaled with cell length.
    pixelSize : float
                Conversion factor between pixels and Âµm.
                
    Returns
    -----------
    dotsPerCell : numpy array with floats 
                  Normalized number of dots per cell within a given range of
                  cell sizes given in area.
    areaBins : numpy array with floats   
               Binned cell areas.
